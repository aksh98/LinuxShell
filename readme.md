This is a basic linux shell in which I implemented some Inbuilt functions such as:
  1. cd
  2. help
  3. kill
  4. history
  5. exit
  
It's a simple shell built using fork/exec/wait system calls. The input commands use stdin and output uses stdout, in an infinite while loop. 
The file run.c is for running the shell in a new window.
